## Bridging the Gap Between Rural Talent and Employment Opportunities 🚜🤝🏙️

### 🎯 Mission
**RuralConnect** is a digital initiative aimed at solving one of India's pressing challenges — unemployment in rural areas. Our mission is to **connect rural job seekers with local and urban employment opportunities**, using a blend of **technology and community-driven solutions**.

By integrating an **online + offline model**, we enable job registration and discovery even in **low-connectivity areas**, with the help of **local agents**. Our platform promotes inclusivity by accommodating users with **low digital literacy**, while offering a rich and user-friendly web experience. 🌍💻

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
Unemployment in rural areas persists due to:
- Lack of platforms tailored to **rural employment needs**
- Low **internet access** and **digital literacy**
- Absence of **local language support** and **on-ground assistance**
- Difficulty in matching **skilled rural labor** with appropriate jobs

Traditional job portals don’t cater to these unique needs, leaving a large segment of the population behind. 🧑‍🌾📉

1. **Job Discovery** for rural youth – from agricultural work to small business employment
2. **Local Agent Model** to help users register and apply offline
